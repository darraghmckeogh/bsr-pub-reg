        <li>at least 2 residential units</li>
        <li>people living in it or about to move in </li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can find out who is responsible for the safety of the building's structure and the parts shared by residents. This organisation or person is also responsible for registering the building with the Buiding Safety Regulator.</p>
