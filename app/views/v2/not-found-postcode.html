      <p>This could be because:</p>

        <li>the building you are looking for has not been registered with the Building Safety Regulator</li>
        <li>you have not entered the postcode correctly</li>
        <li>the building is not a high-rise residential building</li>
        <li>the building is not in England</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Check the details you have entered are correct and <a href="find-postcode">search again</a>. Or <a href="find-building-name-and-city">search by building name and city</a>.</p>

      <p>If you don't think your building has been registered, <a href="#">contact the Building Safety Regulator</a>.</p>
